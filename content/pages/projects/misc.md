I around during the creation of New Blood Interactive and at the beginning of 2014 I decided to learn Illustrator because it seemed like a better way to make logos. The New Blood logo was my first ever design in Illustrator and I'm glad to see it still being used today by Dave and co.

While at New Blood I got to work on some UI and branding for a number of smaller or unreleased games and any sort of branding items we needed for the company at shows, such as business cards, websites, physical banners etc. The last thing I did was the initial logo for DUSK, and that thing did alright it looks.

#### Cancelled Projects

Below are some mockups and implemented work from some games that I worked on that got cancelled.

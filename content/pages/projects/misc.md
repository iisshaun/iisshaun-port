I was around during the creation of New Blood Interactive, and at the start of 2014, I decided to learn Illustrator as it seemed like a more efficient tool for creating logos. The New Blood logo was my first design using Illustrator, and I'm proud to see it still being used today by Dave and the team.

During my time at New Blood, I had the opportunity to work on UI and branding for several smaller or unreleased games, as well as various branding materials for the company, including business cards, websites, physical banners, and more for events and shows. One of the last projects I worked on was the initial logo for DUSK, and that thing did alright.

It was a great to help shape the visual identity of the game at the start and make a small contribution to a fantastic game.

#### Cancelled Projects

Below are some mockups and implemented work from several games I worked on that I didn't get to see the end of. Although these projects didnâ€™t make it to release, they provided valuable experience and allowed me to explore new creative directions.

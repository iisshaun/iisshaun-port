  Stationeers was the first project I got my hands dirty with inside of Unity. I
  designed all of the UI, Marketing, Store page assets and helped with trailers
  and anything else 2D related.

This was my first project to work on at RocketWerkz, a small team of roughly 5-10 at a time. Time with programmers to work on UI was limited as they were focused on the much more complex parts of the game, so designing the UI to be simple and implementable in a short amount of time was crucial for this project.

As Stationeers was an Early Access game we had a lot of updates, especially in our beta branch on Steam so letting the players know what was in these updates was important. With it being an engineering focused game a lot of the community appreciated the in-depth info we provided about what we were adding to the game.

Stationeers being a complex game required a lot of learning for players, so we made tutorials a huge focus later on in development. I made badges they could earn for learning different systems in the game like mission badges astronauts would get from NASA.

The Stationpedia was a great idea from Dean. We used the rich text in TextMeshPro to provide links between different subjects in the game so players could use it like an encyclopedia. Because each page was created at runtime they wouldn't go out of date, so if an item could be created with a new machine then it would say so immediately. This was handy for a game with a smaller playerbase at the time because the community-made wikis would go out of date quickly. The Stationpedia also had some options for navigation and look, it could be resized, made semi-transparent and had a decent search function.

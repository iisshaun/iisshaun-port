By reusing elements from the HUD and establishing universal layouts across all the character customization screens, I was able to speed up the creation process while maintaining consistency throughout.

Later in the Early Access timeline, all of the character customisation screens were redesigned as part of a major push to improve controller support. The original design, with a virtual cursor and a single scrolling list, was cumbersome and frustrating to navigate with a controller. The switch to tabbed categories, along with native controller navigation, made these screens much more intuitive and faster to use. Additionally, to create a cohesive yet distinctive feel, each clothing shop now shares the same background border used by the regular shops in the game, allowing them to feature their own unique colour gradients and logo.

Players can furnish their safehouses with items purchased from shops and structures they've unlocked, customizing their space to their liking. They can also invite "Homies" to move in, provided the house meets the necessary requirements. By increasing the house's value with more items, players can enhance the stats of any Homie residing there, as indicated by the flame icons, which represent the stat boosts they receive.

The ModShop was a relatively quick and straightforward screen to design and implement. On the left, categories are displayed with the number of unlocks discovered next to each one. The most enjoyable part for me, however, was creating the various paint jobs for the vehicles.

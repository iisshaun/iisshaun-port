  Customisation is a big part of It's Only Money, not just to do with the
  Character, but also their Vehicles and Houses as well.

Reusing elements from the HUD and making universal layouts between all of the character customisation screens made these screens quicker to create but also consistent with each other.

All of the character customisation screens were redesigned later in the Early Access timeline when we did a big push and focus on supporting controllers properly. These screens got quite messy and annoying to use with a virtual cursor and a scrolling list of everything on controller, so the move to tabbed categories was obvious and native controller navigation made these screens so much easier and quicker to navigate for players. Using the same background border as the normal shops in the rest of the game, each clothing shop can also have a unique colour gradient and logo associated with it.

Players can furnish their safehouses with items bought from shops and structures they've unlocked. They can also move in "Homies" if the house meets the required needs. Increasing the value of the house with more items means that the Homie placed in said house will gain additional stat boosts as denoted by the flame icons. 

IMAGE OF MODSHOP

The ModShop was a fairly quick and simple screen to design and implement. Categories on the left are shown with the amount of unlocks discovered shown next to them. The really fun part for me here was making some of the paint jobs for the vehicles.

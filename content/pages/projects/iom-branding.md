Throughout Early Access we released major updates as new chapters to further progress the story and add major features to the game. Each chapter had a unique theme for its logo to match the type of content we were adding to the game. We also released a demo for It's Only Money and called it Minimum Wage Edition.

![](/images/Chapter%20Two%20Bento.jpg)![](/images/bento%203.jpg)![](/images/bento%204@2x.jpg)Bento boxes were a fantastic way for us to show how much content we were packing into our major updates. I made one of these for each chapter from Chapter Zero to full release to compliment our Steam posts and trailers.

During Early Access, we introduced major updates in the form of new chapters that advanced the story and brought significant features to the game. Each chapter was accompanied by a distinct logo, reflecting the unique content we were adding at the time. Additionally, we launched a demo for It's Only Money, titled "Minimum Wage", giving players a sneak peek of the experience.

Bento boxes became an excellent way for us to showcase the abundance of content packed into our major updates. I created a unique bento box for each chapter, from Chapter Zero all the way to the full release, to complement our Steam posts and trailers.

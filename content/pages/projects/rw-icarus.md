My role on ICARUS was more supplementary than previous projects I'd worked on, but I was able to achieve some fun goals while working on it regardless. Designing the Steam Store takeover image, launch popup GIF and store capsule images were one of these highlights.

On the HUD itself I got the task of redesigning things like the vitals area in the bottom left, the weather radar in the top right, stamina and encumbrance bars and also removing and hiding elements when they weren't necessary to tidy it up.

A late add in the game was the Accolades System. This system was added by two programmers and myself with about a week before full release. The above ribbons are representative of the final output, I ended up making nearly 350 ribbons within a couple of days for this system. The tracking system actually worked out wonderfully and there were very few bugs to fix before we released it.

Along with the UI and store page assets I also worked closely with the marketing team especially with the rollout of the Beta Weekends we ran in the months leading up to release. Each playtest we would introduce a new feature and part of the map for players to explore and report their feedback back to us. This worked out great as a way to get players and streamers on-board and familiar with the game.

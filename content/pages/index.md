      I started my career with New Blood Interactive in 2014, worked over 5
      years with RocketWerkz Studios and then nearly 3 years with my friends at
      Usual Suspects Studios.


      <br>


      Below you will see some of the work I've created over the years,
      including:


      *   **UI/UX Programming** in **Unreal's Blueprint**.


      *   **Logos** and **Branding** for companies, games and lore-based brands
      inside of those game universes.


      *   **Marketing** material, both for storefronts like **Steam** and also
      physical media such at events such as **PAX**, **Gamescom** etc.


      *   I've also completed projects requiring **UI Shaders**, **Level
      Design**, **Lighting**, **Game Design**, and **Textures** for 3D Assets.

          Customisation is a big part of It's Only Money, not just to do with

      It's Only Money was made by only 5 full-time devs including myself,
      because of that you'll see that I managed to get my hands into a lot
      aspects of the game. During my time with Usual Suspects I was able to push
      myself much further not just in terms of UI/UX design but also getting a
      greater understanding of UMG, Materials and programming with Blueprint in
      Unreal Engine. All of the UI here was created, implemented and mostly
      programmed by myself from start to finish.

      I have over 10 years experience in the videogame industry. I started my
      career with New Blood Interactive in 2014, worked over 5 years with
      RocketWerkz Studios and then nearly 3 years with my friends at Usual
      Suspects Studios. I'm based in Dunedin, New Zealand and open to new
      opportunities.

      I started my career with New Blood Interactive in 2014, worked over 5
      years with RocketWerkz Studios and then nearly 3 years with my friends at
      Usual Suspects Studios.


      <br>


      Below you will see some of the work I've created over the years,
      including:


      *   **UI Assets** for **Layouts** I've designed in **Adobe Illustrator**
      and **Photoshop**, and the **Implementation** of these inside **Unreal
      Engine** and **Unity**.


      *   **UI/UX Programming** inside **Unreal** using **Blueprint**.


      *   **Logos** and **Branding** for companies, games and lore-based brands
      inside of those games.


      *   **Marketing** material, both for storefronts like **Steam** and also
      physical media for events such as **PAX** and **Gamescom**.


      *   I've also completed projects requiring **UI Shaders**, **Level
      Design**, **Lighting**, **Game Design** and **Textures** for 3D Assets.

    title: Usual Suspects | 2022-2024
    text: >
      It's Only Money was made by only 5 full-time devs including myself,
      because of this I managed to get my hands on a lot aspects of the game.
      During my time with Usual Suspects I was able to really push myself
      further not just in terms of UI/UX design but also gaining greater
      knowledge of UMG, Materials and programming with Blueprint in Unreal
      Engine. All of the UI here was created, implemented and mostly programmed
      by myself from start to finish.

          The HUD for It's Only Money has a ton of unique designs for all of the
          individual elements. Making all of these cohesive with each other was
          a fun challenge.

          Customisation is a big part of It's Only Money, not only for the

      Even though I am extremely comfortable working with the Adobe Suite and
      Unreal Engine - I am currently working on a project in the Godot Engine
      mainly to learn GDScript and improve my knowledge writing code vs visual
      scripting. I'm also using this as an opportunity for me to get comfortable
      with some other programs like the Affinity Designer, Aseprite, DaVinci
      Resolve and Ableton.


      I plan to have some updates on my progress on [my Bluesky
      account](https://bsky.app/profile/idiot.bsky.social).

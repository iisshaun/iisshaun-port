      I started my career with New Blood Interactive in 2014, worked over 5
      years with RocketWerkz Studios and then nearly 3 years with my friends at
      Usual Suspects Studios.


      <br>


      Below you will see some of the work I've created over the years,
      including:


      *   **UI Assets** for **Layouts** I've designed in **Adobe Illustrator**
      and **Photoshop**, and the **Implementation** of these inside of **Unreal
      Engine**, and **Unity**.


      *   **UI/UX Programming** inside **Unreal** using **Blueprint**.


      *   **Logos** and **Branding** for companies, games and lore-based brands
      inside of those game universes.


      *   **Marketing** material, both for storefronts like **Steam** and also
      physical media such at events such as **PAX**, **Gamescom** etc.


      *   I've also completed projects requiring **UI Shaders**, **Level
      Design**, **Lighting**, **Game Design**, and **Textures** for 3D Assets.

      It's Only Money was made by only 5 full-time devs including myself,
      because of that you'll see that I managed to get my hands into a lot
      aspects of the game. During my time with Usual Suspects I was able to push
      myself much further not just in terms of UI/UX design but also getting a
      greater understanding of UMG, Materials and programming with Blueprint in
      Unreal Engine. All of the UI here was created, implemented and mostly
      programmed by myself from start to finish.

    text: >
      Even though I am extremely comfortable working with the Adobe Suite and
      Unreal Engine - I am currently working on a project in the Godot Engine
      mainly to learn GDScript and improve my knowledge writing code vs visual
      scripting. I'm also using this as an opportunity for me to get comfortable
      with some other programs like the Affinity Designer, Aseprite, DaVinci
      Resolve and Ableton.


      I plan to have some updates on my progress on [my Bluesky
      account](https://bsky.app/profile/idiot.bsky.social).
